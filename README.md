# Next Word Prediction

This project is designed to predict the next word in a given text sequence using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep-learning models. It implements sequence-modeling architectures such as LSTM and GRU to capture patterns in text data, preprocesses input text with NLP techniques, and aims to improve prediction accuracy using advanced neural networks.
